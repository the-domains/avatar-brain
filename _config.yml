description: ' A HAPPY MISSION                                                                How coincidental that “Happiness,” the word for that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap "chance, fortune, luck." Yet, our chances of attaining it, increase over the long term, with our ability to preserve CEREBRAL, PHYSICAL, FINANCIAL, and SOCIAL HEALTH.   Thus, our mission is to teach as many people as possible, how to stay long-term healthy in those four areas and hopefully,  grow their chances of finding happiness for themselves, their families, and their communities.       FOUR STATES OF HEALTH:              I. CEREBRAL:  Our interest is in how the brain truly works and how it is used by entities other than yourself to determine your state of health in all other areas of life. Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easy how this is happening. For instance:   a. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit in a computer, but regarding our brain, it might mean Congenital Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System).   b. OS stands for Operating System in the computer, it might mean Organized Screener (Prefrontal Cortex).   c. I/O stands for Input and Output devices, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. In our case, I/O devices are our eyes, ears, skin and other Sensation and Perception devices, managed by our Somatosensory Systems.   d. Software: in contrast to the physical hardware such as the CPU and I/O devices, the software is the information and instructions encoded in computer language and fed to the computer to make it work a certain way. In our case, the software is the information and instructions encoded via colors, flavors, aromas, textures, etc. fed to our brains to make us behave a certain way or prefer certain products.            II. PHYSICAL:  You will find that over 80% of the products we use every day for both categories below are either harmful or at best useless.   a. Nutrition   b. Exercise           III. FINANCIAL:  The only concepts one needs to master to understand any financial product are listed below.   a. Interest rates (the price of uncertainty)   b. Net Present Value (discounting the value of future cash flows)   c. Information Asymmetry (what others know beforehand and you don’t, can make all the difference)          IV. SOCIAL:  On why you must reformat your brain regarding social status and then consider which of your parents or extended family members’ values are most likely to help your mind evolve towards its optimal capacity '
