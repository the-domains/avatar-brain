For centuries, they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 &horbar;Christopher McDougall">]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[INFORMATION ASYMMETRY]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong><a href="http://www.infoasy.com/">INFORMATION ASYMMETRY</a></strong></h1>,<p><strong>Queridos Hijos</strong>,<br>Below, I review four precepts collected over a decade seeking answers to the "Simulation" dilemma presented by Matrix (1999) and accidentally... Finding (stumbling upon) them, in the least expected places: <strong>Appendix B</strong>.<br>For instance, upon learning that<strong><a href="http://nobaproject.com/modules/sensation-and-perception">sensory adaptation</a></strong>makes our perception (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) highly prone to manipulation, I keep aiming to detoxify my sense of taste, knowing it embeds the <strong><a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/transcripts/1444_lifestyle-choices-root-causes-of-chronic-diseases">food choices</a></strong> and ultimately the <strong><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/">lifestyle diseases</a></strong>, we think our own, unaware that our Matrix-like “Sensory Masters” ingrain them in our brain since infancy.<br>In 2009, after years of research, but mostly by trial &amp; error, I found Fuhrman’s <strong><a href="https://www.drfuhrman.com/learn/the-nutritarian-diet/how-it-works-fundamental-principles">Health = Nutrients Per Calorie</a></strong>approach and the simplest way to execute it: <strong><a href="https://www.drfuhrman.com/learn/library/articles/29/the-healthiest-">G-BOMBS</a></strong>. Since then, I discovered five other pioneering MDs (<strong>Appendix A</strong>) whose work confirms or precedes Fuhrman’s. <br>On the other hand, what led me to these findings was the present era of nearly-free access to information, made possible by Tim Berners-Lee and our Matrix-like complex. So, while the Internet does spread a <strong><a href="http://www.snopes.com/search/?q=urban+legend">million lies</a></strong>, when carefully vetted, today’s infinite information bounty gives you a degree of control over your destiny, no previous generation ever had... Or, it can turn you into a slave to the myriad addictive virtual worlds,<strong>whose food is your existence</strong>.<br><strong>Love,</strong><br><strong>Dad</strong></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52a8b74b-60b5-4592-9cb8-9ed472d85d0f.jpg">]]></description>
