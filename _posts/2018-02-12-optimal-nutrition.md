* Do not eat sugar in any form. Sugar is poison. This means no candy, fruit juices, bread, pasta, honey etc. There are many disagreements about nutrition science. That sugar is extremely bad for you is not one of them.
* Do not eat processed foods. Eat natural food instead.
* Do not eat cheap industrially-farmed animal products.
* Eat mostly plants although I feel going entirely vegetarian for health reasons is not justified.
* Eat organic when possible, especially when discussing animal products. Generally spend more money on food --- the cheaper the food, the more "hacks" the producer used to be able to deliver that price. Many of these hacks are harmful --- they inject saline solution to increase weight, feed dead animals to live animals, use antibiotics a lot etc.
* In my opinion one shouldn't drink any alcohol (screws up sleep) or add any salt (increases blood pressure) to food.
