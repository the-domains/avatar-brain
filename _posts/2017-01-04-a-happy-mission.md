# **We Are Our Brain's Avatar**

## How coincidental that "Happiness," that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap "chance, fortune, luck." Fortunately, our chances of attaining it, increase over the long term, with our ability to preserve our Cerebral, Physical, Financial, and Social health

## FOUR-DIMENSIONAL HEALTH

### **CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE):** Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easier to understand, how external entities can determine our state of health via grooming our perceptual experiences since childhood

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, but regarding our brain it might as well stand for Congenitally Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System)

OS stands for Operating System in the computer, yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex) in our case

I/O (Input/Output) devices similar to the monitor, keyboard or mouse, are the sensory receptors linked to our brain: our eyes, ears, taste buds, skin, etc.

SOFTWARE, commands fed to computers to do their work, are fed to us since infancy via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, textures, etc. to mold those stimuli that cause us enough pleasure to consume, even if aware of their hidden harm

### **PHYSICAL (HARDWARE):** Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over the long-term. For instance, when it comes to:

Nutrition, keeping our brain healthy depends on nutrition more than any other factor. Yet, as this _**[summary explains][0]**_, it may be impossible to change our fate in this area, unless we realize that our sense of taste has been groomed since childhood, to favor someone else's economic interests, regardless of its long-term effects on our health.

Exercise, most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion that fuels a yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache Runners][1]**_ and explained by Chris McDougall (_**[Appendix B link][0]**_), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface of the road we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### **FINANCIAL (POWER):** Over time, we will review the 3 key concepts behind financial products. For now, the links below only provide perspective on how each of them can impact financial matters

_**[Interest Rates][2]**_ (the price of uncertainty)

_**[Net Present Value][3]**_ (uncertainty rules value of future cash flows)

_**[Information Asymmetry][4]**_ (timely data can rule uncertainty)

### **SOCIAL (NETWORK) **Social interaction follows "rules of engagement" established by our animal-brain's perceived social status. Thus, editing our "net protocol" for optimal health, rests on identifying, committing, and incorporating high-rank behavior codes despite unique constrains
