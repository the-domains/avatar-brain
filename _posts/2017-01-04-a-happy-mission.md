# **A Happy Mission**

## **How coincidental that "Happiness," that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap "chance, fortune, luck." Fortunately, our chances of attaining it, increase over the long term, with our ability to preserve our Cerebral, Physical, Financial, and Social health.**

## **Four-Dimensional Health**

## **Cerebral**

**Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easier to understand, how external entities can determine our state of health via grooming our perceptual experiences since childhood:**

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, but regarding our brain it might as well stand for Congenitally Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System).

OS stands for Operating System in the computer, yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex) in our case.

I/O stands for Input and Output devices (monitor, keyboard, mouse). Our I/O devices are the eyes, ears, skin and perception organs managed by our brain's sensory system.

SOFTWARE, the instructions fed to computers to do their work, is encoded in us via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, textures, etc. fed to our sensory organs from an early age, to mold the set of stimuli that produce positive feedback (pleasure).

## **Physical**

**Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over the long-term. For instance, when it comes to:**

Nutrition, keeping our brain healthy depends on nutrition more than any other factor. Yet, as this _**[summary explains][0]**_, it may be impossible to change our fate in this area, unless we realize that our sense of taste has been groomed since childhood, to favor someone else's economic interests, regardless of its long-term effects on our health.

Exercise, most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion that fuels a yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache Runners][1]**_ and better explained by Christopher McDougall (_**[Appendix B link][0]**_), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface of the road we run on, the higher the likelihood of injury.

## **Financial**

**Over time, we will review three concepts to understand financial products. For now, the links are there to offer perspectives on how each can impact financial matters.**

_**[Interest Rates][2]**_ (the price of uncertainty)

_**[Net Present Value][3]**_ (discounting the value of future cash flows)

_**[Information Asymmetry][4]**_ (what others know before we do, makes the difference)

## **Social**

**On why we may need to "reformat our CPU" regarding social status, per which parent or extended family member's "wiring" is most likely to help us develop our optimal "net protocol" or "rules of engagement" for social interaction.**

## **TO BE CONTINUED...**
