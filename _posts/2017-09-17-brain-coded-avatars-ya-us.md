  Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth ―Marcus Aurelius

  Visualizing our brain as a web-server and culture as a network, reveals why
  identical perceptual experiences cause myriad interpretations and with each, a
  different destiny

  CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE)

  Imagine our brains are web servers powering a +7 billion network, where
  culture is a web-server language, while human language can only code web
  content. Question: If a group of coders became aware of this design, would
  they tell us? Or would they concentrate on coding “cultural illusions” they
  can sell to the rest of us, so they can choose their destiny, over ours?

  KEYMAKER

  CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, yet regarding our brain, it refers to
  our Limbic System: Completely Primitive Unconscious

  OS stands for Operating System in computers. Organized Screener in our case,
  one of the many executive functions of the Prefrontal Cortex

  I/O (Input/Output) monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. help CPUs interact, as our
  sensory receptors (eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, skin, etc.) help us

  Software Contains the commands for computers to do their work. In our case,
  these commands are fed since infancy, via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas,
  etc. to set what stimuli spur enough dopamine to keep us coming for more

  PHYSICAL (HARDWARE)

  Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at
  best useless over time. For instance, when it comes to:

  Nutrition Keeping our brain healthy depends on this factor more than any. Yet,
  as shown in Hack The Matrix, it is difficult to change our fate in this area,
  unless we realize our senses were bred since young, to crave foods bearing no
  nutritional value and high odds of triggering irreversible cell-damage

  Exercise Most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of
  unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our yearning for useless gear. For
  instance, as posted in Huarache Runners and explained by Chris McDougall
  (Appendix B), the larger the gap between our soles’ nerve endings and the
  surface we run on, the higher the potential for injury

  FINANCIAL (POWER)

  Linked below are 3 concepts that provide long-range perspective on what truly
  underlies financial matters

  Interest Rates: The price of uncertainty

  Net Present Value: Uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows

  Information Symmetry: Insight*People/Uncertainty= EXP Wealth Growth

  SOCIAL (NETWORK)

  Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal
  brain’s perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our “net protocol” rests on
  identifying, committing to, and incorporating high-rank behavior code, despite
  unique constraints
