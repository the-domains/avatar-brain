# **PHYSICAL ―\> HARDWARE**

**[Optimal Nutrition][0]** by Serge Faguet

Do not eat sugar in any form. **Sugar is poison**. This means no candy, fruit juices, bread, pasta, honey etc. There are many disagreements about nutrition science. That sugar is extremely bad for you is not one of them.

* Do not eat processed foods. Eat natural food instead.
* Do not eat cheap industrially-farmed animal products.
* Eat mostly plants although I feel going entirely vegetarian for health reasons is not justified.
* Eat organic when possible, especially when discussing animal products. Generally spend more money on food --- the cheaper the food, the more "hacks" the producer used to be able to deliver that price. Many of these hacks are harmful --- they inject saline solution to increase weight, feed dead animals to live animals, use antibiotics a lot etc.
* In my opinion one shouldn't drink any alcohol (screws up sleep) or add any salt (increases blood pressure) to food.
