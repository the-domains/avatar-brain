  Below, I review four precepts collected over a decade seeking answers to the
  "Simulation" dilemma presented by Matrix (1999) and accidentally... Finding
  (stumbling upon) them, in the least expected places: Appendix B.For instance,
  upon learning thatsensory adaptationmakes our perception (sight, hearing,
  taste, smell, and touch) highly prone to manipulation, I keep aiming to
  detoxify my sense of taste, knowing it embeds the food choices and ultimately
  the lifestyle diseases, we think our own, unaware that our Matrix-like
  “Sensory Masters” ingrain them in our brain since infancy.In 2009, after years
  of research, but mostly by trial & error, I found Fuhrman’s Health = Nutrients
  Per Calorieapproach and the simplest way to execute it: G-BOMBS. Since then, I
  discovered five other pioneering MDs (Appendix A) whose work confirms or
  precedes Fuhrman’s. On the other hand, what led me to these findings was the
  present era of nearly-free access to information, made possible by Tim
  Berners-Lee and our Matrix-like complex. So, while the Internet does spread a
  million lies, when carefully vetted, today’s infinite information bounty gives
  you a degree of control over your destiny, no previous generation ever had...
  Or, it can turn you into a slave to the myriad addictive virtual worlds,whose
  food is your existence.
