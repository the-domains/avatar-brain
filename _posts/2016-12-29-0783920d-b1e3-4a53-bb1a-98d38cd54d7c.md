  "Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive
  Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost
  art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run
  hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an
  Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is
  matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the
  diseases and strife that plague modern existence." ―Christopher McDougall
