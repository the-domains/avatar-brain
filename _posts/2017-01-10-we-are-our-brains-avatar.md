## **We Are Our Brain's Avatar**

### **Happiness, that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap (chance, fortune, luck), yet our odds of seizing it rise, the longer we preserve FOUR-DIMENSIONAL HEALTH:**

### **CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE)**: Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easier to understand how external entities can determine our state of health via grooming our perceptual experiences since early in life:

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, but regarding our brain, it might as well stand for Completely Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System)

OS stands for Operating System in the computer, yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex), in our case

I/O (Input/Output) devices like monitor, keyboard, or mouse, in our case are the sensory receptors linked to our brain: eyes, ears, taste buds, skin, nasal glands, etc.

SOFTWARE, commands fed to computers to do their work, are fed to us since infancy via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, feel, etc. to set what stimuli will cause us to consume products for pleasure, even if we know they cause long-term harm

### **PHYSICAL (HARDWARE)**: Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over time. For instance, when it comes to:

Nutrition, keeping our brain healthy depends on nutrition more than any other factor. Yet, as this _**[summary][0]**_ explains, it may not be possible to change our fate in this area, unless we realize that our senses were groomed since infancy to favor consumption of foods low in nutritional-value and with high odds of starting irreversible cell damage

Exercise, most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache][1]**_ Runners and explained by Chris McDougall (_**[Appendix B][0]**_), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### **FINANCIAL (POWER)**: Over time, we will review three concepts that underlie all financial products. For now, the links below provide long-range perspective on how each of them can impact financial matters

_**[Interest Rates][2]**:the price of uncertainty_

_**[Net Present Value][3]**:uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows_

_**[Information Symmetry][4]**: **I**nsight**\*P**eople**/U**ncertainty**=EXP W**ealth **G**rowth_

### **SOCIAL (NETWORK):** Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal-brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net protocol" rests on identifying, committing, and incorporating high-rank behavior codes, despite unique constrains
