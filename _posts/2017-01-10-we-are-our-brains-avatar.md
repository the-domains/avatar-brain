## **UNLESS WE RECODE IT, OUR BRAIN WILL FEED OUR AVATAR TO THE NETWORK'S CODERS**

### **Visualizing our brain as a computer node and culture as a network can help us grasp how perceptual experience decides our destiny**

### Imagine our brains were web servers powering a +7 billion network, cultures were web server languages, while human language is only good to code web content. Question: if a group of coders became aware of this design, would they tell everyone? Or concentrate on learning web-server coding, so they become the richest 1% on earth?

**CPU** stands for Central Processing Unit, but regarding our brain, it might as well stand for Completely Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System)

**OS** stands for Operating System in a computer, yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex), in our case

**I/O** (Input/Output) devices like monitor, keyboard, or mouse, in us, are the sensory receptors linked to our brain: eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, skin, etc.

**Software** commands fed to computers to do their work are fed to us via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, etc. since infancy to set what stimuli spur enough pleasure to keep us consuming products that we know, pose harm

### PHYSICAL (HARDWARE): Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over time. For instance, when it comes to:

**Nutrition-** keeping our brain healthy depends on this factor more than any other. Yet, as summarized _**[here][0]**_, it is difficult to change our fate in this area, unless we realize our senses were bred since young, to crave foods bearing no nutritional value and high odds of triggering irreversible cell damage

**Exercise-** most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache][1]**_ Runners and explained by Chris McDougall (_**[Appendix B][0]**_), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### FINANCIAL (POWER): Over time, we will explain three concepts that underlie all financial products. For now, the links below provide long-range perspective on how each of them can impact financial matters

_**[Interest Rates][2]**: The price of uncertainty_

_**[Net Present Value][3]**: Uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows_

_**[Information Symmetry][4]**_: _**I**nsight**\*P**eople**/U**ncertainty**= EXP W**ealth **G**rowth_

### SOCIAL (NETWORK): Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net protocol" rests on identifying, committing to, and incorporating high-rank behavior codes, despite unique constraints
