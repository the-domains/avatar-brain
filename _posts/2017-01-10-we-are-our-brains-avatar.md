# **We Are Our Brain's Avatar**

## Happiness, that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap "chance, fortune, luck" and the odds of seizing it, increase with our grasp of FOUR-DIMENSIONAL HEALTH:

### **CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE)**: Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easier to understand, how external entities can determine our state of health via grooming our perceptual experiences since childhood

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, but regarding our brain it might as well stand for Completely Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System)

OS stands for Operating System in the computer, yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex) in our case

I/O (Input/Output) devices similar to the monitor, keyboard or mouse, are the sensory receptors linked to our brain: eyes, ears, taste buds, skin, etc.

SOFTWARE, commands fed to computers to do their work, are fed to us since infancy via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, feel, etc. to set what stimuli cause us to consume products for pleasure, even if we know they pose harm

### **PHYSICAL (HARDWARE)**:Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over the long-term. For instance, when it comes to:

Nutrition, keeping our brain healthy depends on nutrition more than any other factor. Yet, as this _**[summary explains][0]**_, it may be impossible to change our fate in this area, unless we realize that our sense of taste has been groomed since childhood, to favor someone else's economic interests, regardless of its long-term effects on our health.

Exercise, most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion that fuels a yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache Runners][1]**_ and explained by Chris McDougall (_**[Appendix B link][0]**_), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface of the road we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### **FINANCIAL (POWER)**: Over time, we will review the 3 key concepts behind financial products. For now, the links below provide long-range perspective on how each of them can impact financial matters

_**[Interest Rates][2]: **_the price of uncertainty

_**[Net Present Value][3]: **_uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows

_**[Information Symmetry][4]: **_insight\*people/uncertainty=exp wealth growth

### **SOCIAL (NETWORK)**: Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal-brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net protocol" rests on identifying, committing, and incorporating high-rank behavior codes, despite unique constrains

### **TO BE CONTINUED...**
