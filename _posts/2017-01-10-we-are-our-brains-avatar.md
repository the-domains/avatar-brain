## **UNLESS WE RECODE IT, OUR BRAIN WILL FEED OUR AVATAR TO THE "NETWORK'S CODERS"**

### _**Visualizing our brain as a node in a human server network can help us grasp why/how perceptual experience decides our destiny.**_

## **KEYMAKER**

### **CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE) **Imagine our brains are web servers powering a +7 billion network, where culture is a web-server language, while human language can only code web content. Question: If a group of coders became aware of this design, would they tell us? Or would they concentrate on coding "cultural illusions" they can sell to the rest of us, so they can become the most powerful elite on earth?

### **CPU** stands for Central Processing Unit, yet regarding our brain, it refers to our Limbic System: Completely Primitive Unconscious

### **OS** stands for Operating System in computers. Organized Screener in our case, one of the many executive functions of the Prefrontal Cortex

### **I/O** (Input/Output) monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. help CPUs interact, as our sensory receptors (eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, skin, etc.) help us

### **Software** commands rule computer actions. In our case, they are fed from infancy via sound, color, flavor, touch, etc. to set what stimuli spur enough dopamine to keep us consuming products, we know pose harm

### **PHYSICAL (HARDWARE)** Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over time. For instance, when it comes to:

### **Nutrition**- keeping our brain healthy depends on this factor more than any other. Yet, as _**[Hack The Matrix][0]**_ shows, we can't change our fate in this area, unless we realize our senses were bred to crave foods bearing no nutritional value and high odds of triggering irreversible cell damage

### **Exercise**- most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache Runners][1]**_ and explained by Chris McDougall (_**[Appendix B][0]**_), the larger the gap between our sole's nerve endings and the surface we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### **FINANCIAL (POWER)** Over time, we will explain three concepts that underlie all financial products. For now, the links below provide long-range perspective on how each of them can impact financial matters

### _**[Interest Rates][2]**: The price of uncertainty_

### _**[Net Present Value][3]**: Uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows_

### _**[Information Symmetry][4]**_: _**I**nsight**\*P**eople**/U**ncertainty**= EXP W**ealth **G**rowth_

### **SOCIAL (NETWORK)** Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net protocol" rests on identifying, committing to, and incorporating high-rank behavior codes, despite unique constraints
