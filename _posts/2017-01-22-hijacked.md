# HIJACKED!

### **Despite her entering the weight-loss industry, NISOD Excellence Award professor, double PhD (Brain & Cognitive Sciences) & Berkeley summa cum laude, Dr. Susan Peirce's video is irrefutable: Form, rather than "Substance" lurks behind all addictive foods**

**CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE): **2 of the substances pictured here are everyday foods, the other 2 are street drugs. All 4 cause dopamine-spike responses from the [Limbic System][0] that hijack our [Pre-frontal Cortex][1]'s ability to think. This part of [Dr. Peirce's video][2], starts on minute 35:00, yet [all of it is worth watching][3]
