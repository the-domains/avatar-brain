# HIJACKED!

## **Despite having entered the weight-loss industry, NISOD Excellence Award professor, double PhD (Brain & Cognitive Sciences) & Berkeley summa cum laude, [Dr. Susan Peirce's][0] video is irrefutable: Form, rather than "Substance" lurks [behind all addictive foods][1]**

### **CEREBRAL (SOFTWARE): **2 of the substances pictured here are everyday foods, the other 2 are street drugs. All 4 cause dopamine-spike responses from the [Limbic System][2] that hijack our [Pre-frontal Cortex][3]'s ability to think. This part of Dr. Peirce's video, starts on minute 35, yet all of it is worth watching
