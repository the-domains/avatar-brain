# **CEREBRAL ―\> PROGRAMMING**

## HEALTH HIJACK!

Berkeley _summa cum laude_, double PhD (Brain + Cognitive Sciences) and NISOD Excellence Award professor, Dr. Susan Peirce shows why form (NOT substance) makes food addictive. Another proof that cultural brainwash runs our "common sense" beliefs system.

TWO of the substances in this picture are everyday FOODS, the other two are STREET DRUGS. All FOUR cause dopamine-spikes that allow our [Limbic System][0] to HIJACK our [Pre-frontal Cortex][1]'s ABILITY TO THINK ([min 35][2]).
