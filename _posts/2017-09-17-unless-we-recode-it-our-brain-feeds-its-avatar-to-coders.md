## KEYMAKER

**CPU:** Stands for Central Processing Unit, yet regarding our brain, it refers to our Limbic System: Completely Primitive Unconscious

**OS: **Stands for Operating System in computers. Organized Screener in our case, one of the many executive functions of the Prefrontal Cortex

**I/O: **(Input/Output) monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. help CPUs interact, as our sensory receptors (eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, skin, etc.) help us

**CODE: **Contains the commands that computers follow. We get fed these from infancy, via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, etc. to set what stimuli spur enough dopamine in our brain to keep us coming back for more

**FOUR STATES OF HEALTH:** Cerebral, Physical, Financial and Social

### **CEREBRAL ――――――――\> PROGRAMMING**

Imagine our brains as servers powering a +7 billion network, where culture is a server-code and language can only code content. Question: If a group of coders became aware of this design, would they tell us? Or would they focus on coding "cultural illusions" to steer the rest of us in favor of their own destiny?

### **PHYSICAL ――――――――\> HARDWARE**

Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over time. For instance, when it comes to:

**Nutrition: **Keeping our brain healthy depends on this factor more than any. Yet, as shown in **[Hack the Matrix][0]**, it is difficult to change our fate in this area, unless we realize our senses were bred since young, to crave foods bearing no nutritional value and high odds of triggering irreversible cell-damage

**Exercise: **Most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in **[Huarache Runners][1]** and explained by Chris McDougall (**[Appendix B][0])**, the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface we run on, the higher the potential for injury

### **FINANCIAL ―――――――---\> POWER**

Linked below are 3 concepts that provide long-range perspective on what truly underlies financial matters

* [INFORMATION SYMMETRY][2]: INSIGHT\*PEOPLE/UNCERTAINTY= EXP WEALTH GROWTH

* [INTEREST RATES][3]: THE PRICE OF UNCERTAINTY

* [NET PRESENT VALUE][4]: PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS RULE THE VALUE OF ALL INCOME

### **SOCIAL ―――――――――\> NETWORK**

Social interaction follows rules of engagement established by our animal brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net protocol" rests on identifying, committing to, and incorporating high-rank behavior code, despite unique constraints
