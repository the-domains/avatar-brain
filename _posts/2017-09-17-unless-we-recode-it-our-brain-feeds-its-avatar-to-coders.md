# **UNLESS WE RECODE IT, OUR BRAIN FEEDS ITS AVATAR TO CODERS**

## Visualizing our brain as a computer node and culture as a network can help
us grasp how perceptual experience decides our destiny

### Imagine culture was a web-server language, while human languages were just
code to provide content for a +7 billion network of brain-servers. Question: if
a group of coders became aware of this design, would they tell everyone? Or
would they concentrate on learning web-server language, so they could become
the richest 1% on earth?

## KEY-MAKER:

**CPU** Stands for Central Processing Unit, but
regarding our brain, it might as well stand for Completely Primitive
Unconscious (Limbic System)

**OS** Stands for Operating System in a computer,
yet it could mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex), in our case

**I/O** (Input/Output) Devices like monitor,
keyboard, or mouse, similar to the sensory receptors linked to our brain: eyes,
ears, nose, taste buds, skin, etc.

**Software** Contains the commands for computers to
do their work. In our case, these commands are fed since infancy, via sounds,
colors, flavors, aromas, etc. to set what stimuli spur enough dopamine to keep
us coming for more

**Hardware **Many of the foods and habits said to
prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over time. For instance,
when it comes to:

**Nutrition** Keeping our brain healthy depends on
this factor more than any. Yet, as shown in _**[Hack The Matrix][0]**_,
it is difficult to change our fate in this area, unless we realize our senses
were bred since young, to crave foods bearing no nutritional value and high
odds of triggering irreversible cell-damage

**Exercise **Most of us think of it as a way of
counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, a notion fueling our
yearning for useless gear. For instance, as posted in _**[Huarache][1]**_ Runners and explained by Chris
McDougall (_**[Appendix B][0]**_), the larger the gap between our
soles' nerve endings and the surface we run on, the higher the potential for
injury

**Power** (Finance) Linked below are 3 concepts
underlie that provide long-range perspective on what truly underlies financial
matters

_**[Interest Rates][2]**:
The price of uncertainty_

_**[Net Present Value][3]**:
Uncertainty rules the value of future cash flows_

_**[Information Symmetry][4]**_:
_**I**nsight**\*P**eople**/U**ncertainty**=
EXP W**ealth **G**rowth_

#### Network (Social) Social interaction follows rules of engagement established
by our animal brain's perceived social status. Thus, optimizing our "net
protocol" rests on identifying, committing to, and incorporating high-rank
behavior code, despite unique constraints
