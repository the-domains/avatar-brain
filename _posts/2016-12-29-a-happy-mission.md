  "Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive
  Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost
  art. For centuries, they have practiced techniques that allow them to run
  hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an
  Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is
  matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the
  diseases and strife that plague modern existence." ―Christopher McDougall

# **A Happy Mission**

### How coincidental that "Happiness," that elusive state of being among living creatures, derives from hap "chance, fortune, luck." Fortunately, our chances of attaining it, increase over the long term, with our ability to preserve our Cerebral, Physical, Financial, and Social health.

## **Four-Dimensional Health**

## **Cerebral**

## Visualizing our brain as a computer makes it easier to understand, how external entities can determine our state of health via grooming our perceptual experiences since childhood, for economic interest:

### CPU stands for Central Processing Unit in a computer, but regarding our brain it might as well stand for Congenitally Primitive Unconscious (Limbic System).

### OS which stands for Operating System in the computer, might mean Organized Screener (Pre-frontal Cortex) in our case.

### I/O stands for Input and Output devices, such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. In our case, the I/O devices are our eyes, ears, skin and other Sensation and Perception organs managed by our brain's sensory systems.

### SOFTWARE in contrast to the physical hardware such as the CPU and I/O devices, the software is the information and instructions encoded in computer language and fed to it to make it work a certain way. In our case, software is the information and instructions encoded via sounds, colors, flavors, aromas, textures, etc. fed to our brains through our sensory organs to make us behave certain ways, prefer certain products, control the extent of our actions, etc.

## **Physical**

## Many of the foods and habits said to prolong our health might be harmful or at best useless over the long-term. For instance, when it comes to:

### Nutrition, keeping our brain healthy depends on nutrition more than any other factor. Yet, as this **[summary explains][0]**, it may be impossible to change our fate in this area, unless we realize that since childhood, our sense of taste has been groomed in favor of someone else's economic interests, regardless of its long-term potential damage to us.

### Exercise, most of us think of it as a way of counteracting the effects of unhealthy eating habits, it is harder to see how it can harm us without the proper gear. For instance, as posted in **[Huarache Runners][1]** and better explained by Christopher McDougall (**[see Appendix B link][0]**), the larger the gap between our soles' nerve endings and the surface of the road we run on, the higher the likelihood of injury.

## **Financial**

## Over time, we will review three concepts to understand financial products. For now, the links are there to offer perspectives on how each can impact financial matters.

### **[Interest Rates][2]** (the price of uncertainty)

### **[Net Present Value][3]** (discounting the value of future cash flows)

### **[Information Asymmetry][4]** (what others know beforehand and we don't, makes the difference)

## **Social**

## On why we may have to reformat our brains regarding social status per which parent or extended family member' values are most likely to help us evolve towards optimal interaction.
